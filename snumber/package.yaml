synopsis: Integer singletons with flexible representation
description: |
  This provides singletons-style witnesses for type-level integers, and some
  limited arithmetic operations on them.  Instead of working with (invisible,
  implicitly-passed) 'KnownNat' instances, you can work with (visible,
  explicitly-mentioned) 'SNumber' values, and can freely convert between the
  two forms.

  This primarily exists in support of
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-literals-plugin dependent-literals-plugin>.
